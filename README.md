# Java_HTTP_REST_Client

## Brief

a lightweight java client similar to insomnia and postman, for http request using native apis in java 9 featuring:

- mvc model
- command line interface for backend test(jurl)
- diverse request body using multi part format
- saving request and workspace in a non relative persistent method
- swing ui for desktop frontend
- multi threading and workers

possible future improvments:

- proxy emulation and support
- alternating modern java apis for I/O and networking
- alternative ui framework and better threading
- simpler request body format 
- ui workspace persistent completion
- maven/gradle packaging
